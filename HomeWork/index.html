<h2>Ballet is an art</h2>


    <p> What Is Ballet Dance? Ballet dance is a traditional art form that originated over 500 years ago in Italy. </p>
    
    <p> Though ballet dancers are trained to appear gentle and graceful in their movements, ballet technique requires a tremendous amount of strength, balance, technical skill, and flexibility.</p>
   
   
    <p> It also promotes excellent posture, which can help kids in many other areas of their life, even when it comes to alertness in school.</p>
